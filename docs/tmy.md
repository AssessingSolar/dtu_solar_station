# TMY

DTU has contributed to the development of the Danish Design Reference Year dataset, which is a type of Typical Meteorological Year (TMY). The dataset is described in the DMI report [18-20](https://www.dmi.dk/fileadmin/Rapporter/2018/DMI_report_18-20.pdf). The Design Reference Year (DRY) is used in the Danish Building Regulations (BR18).
