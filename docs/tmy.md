# TMY

DTU has contributed to the development of the Danish Design Reference Year (DRY). The DRY dataset is a type of Typical Meteorological Year (TMY). The dataset is described in DMI report [18-20](https://www.dmi.dk/fileadmin/Rapporter/2018/DMI_report_18-20.pdf). Notably, the use of the DRY dataset is required for calculations according to the Danish Building Regulations (BR18).

The updated version of the 2001-2010 DRY dataset can be downloaded {download}`here <../DRY_2001-2010_december_2018_version.zip>`. The TMY data is available in CSV and EPW format.
